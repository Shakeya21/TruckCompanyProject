# Truck Company Project
Welcome to the repository of my first original project for the Truck company.

This application will allow you to manage your employees.
After logging in to the website as an administrator, you can go to the page responsible for adding an employee.

The employee is not a driver, so you don't want to give him a number? No worries, just enter "unknown"!
You can see the list of employees by clicking on the link in the upper right corner, but you will also be redirected there after adding a new employee.

did you make a mistake? Don't worry! When you enable the list of users, the edit option will appear in the "actions" column.

You can also freely manage the user account, its name is created automatically when creating an employee. Don't worry, you can change it too!

An employee has left the company and you no longer want to keep data related to him? Remove it!

You can manage orders in the same way, remember that the user needs the Dispatch or Admin role to manage them.
